Oxygen [b](O2)[/b] reacts with almost all elements.\End products of such reactions are oxides.\eg. [b]Mg + O2 -> MgO[/b] (magnesium oxide)\\Some exceptions are:\- halogens ([b]F, Cl, Br, I, At[/b])\- coinage metals ([b]Pt, Au[/b])\- inert gases\They don't react with oxygen at all.\\Reactions of any chemical compound with oxygen\lead to producing of oxides of each element from compound\such that it reacts with [b]O2[/b].
Hydrogen [b](H2)[/b] allows to reduce metals from their oxides.\Another product of reaction of hydrogen and metal oxide is water.\eg. [b]Na2O + H2 -> H2O + Cu[/b]
On the previous level we used hydrogen to reduce metals, but...\well, how to produce hydrogen itself\if there is no flask with it on the container? :)\\The answer is: use [b]water![/b]\\Active metals with water produce their hydroxides (alkalis)\e.g. [b]Na + H2O -> NaOH + H2[/b]\\Other metals (but only those\which are to the left of [b]H[/b] in [i]reactivity series[/i])\with water produce their oxide and hydrogen.
